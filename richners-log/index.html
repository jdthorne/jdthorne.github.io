I'd been eating and drinking the same 20 liters of water for the past eighteen months.\n\nA shelf above the counter held my food stores. Engineered food was compact and nutritious, but it tasted like stale corn. I sure had a lot of it though.",

It was two meters long, with a 40cm thick adaptive exofoam mattress. \n\nThe Dreams was a fast ship, but even a quick jaunt from Earth to Mars took months. The exofoam mattress kept my body healthy while I slept, and the overhead life support manifold tuned the atmosphere to keep me sedate.\n\nI'd spend a few hours a day eating, exercising, talking with Hayley, or learning from the ship's database, but for most of the trip I slept.\n\nIt wasn't stasis, but it was the next best thing. An interlude was more relaxing than even the best Earth vacation.",

In reality the forward compartments were always a bit cold, and the aft compartments were a bit warm. The oxygen ratio ran a little thin when the engines were running, and it made disconcerting buzzing noises every now and then.\n\nI'd tried cracking it open during my last interlude, but as it turned the unit was completely indestructible. That was probably for the best; life support was important. I'd seen similar units operate in conditions up to and including complete shipwide power loss, thanks to their sealed design and built-in radiothermal generators."

A large curved window was inset into the polysteel hull, providing clear visibility from any angle. Most modern ships use a closed-loop camera system rather than an actual window; whoever designed the Dreams must have had a flare for the dramatic.\n\nIn the center of the room was the pilot's seat, surrounded by glossy control surfaces mounted on a thin metal web. The surfaces combined holographic displays with haptic controls, allowing a skilled pilot to feel the console as well as they could see it. The controls were in an unusual arrangement, but no more unusual than the rest of the Dreams. \n\nBehind the control cluster was an pressure door; the first of four that separated the Dreams' five compartments. The word \"Operations\" was inscribed on the door, and a small window framed the room beyond.",
